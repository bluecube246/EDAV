# NLP Assignment AML-4

## The objective of this assignment is to predict wine quality from review text and other qualities of wine. 
## Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews

### Task 1:
#### 1.1 Create a baseline model for predicting wine quality using only non-text features.
#### 1.2 Create a simple text-based model using a bag-of-words approach and a linear model.
#### 1.3 Try using n-grams, characters, tf-idf rescaling and possibly other ways to tune the BoW model. Be aware that you might need to adjust the (regularization of the) linear model for different feature sets.
#### 1.4 Combine the non-text features and the text features. How does adding those features improve upon just using bag-of-words?

### Task 2:
#### Use a pretrained word-embedding (word2vec, glove or fasttext) for featurization instead of the bag-of-words model. Does this improve classification? How about combining the embedded words with the BoW model?
